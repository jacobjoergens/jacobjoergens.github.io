			<h2>what we do</h2>
				<p> Uncommissioned Design is a platform that connects people looking for custom furniture with a network of producers who can make it for them. </p>
			<h2><a name="platform">how we're doing</h2>
			<p> To date, Uncommissioned Design has been a passion project. We've been taking and making commissions for our friends (mostly fellow UChicago students for the 				past year. Our mission to make custom furniture more accessible for everyone has taken us on another journey. We are currently enrolled in the College New Ventu				re Challenge and are actively researching, developing and testing our business model. You'll find a little slideshow of the projects we're the most proud of bel				ow. <strong> If you're interested in getting a custom piece made or making a custom piece please scroll down to find our contact info and reach out! Before we 					put together the full-fledged platform we're workshopping the customer-producer interaction and would love to make as many connections and learn as much as poss				ible.</strong>
