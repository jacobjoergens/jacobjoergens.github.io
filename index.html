			<p>We believe that everyone is creative, no matter who you are or where you come from.  We also know that not everyone has the opportunity to exercise that creative impulse, but how can we change that?  Whether your ideas come in a trickle or a cascade, everyone should be able to act on that creativity because it’s powerful; it’s a representation of who you are.</p>
			<p>When we founded Uncommissioned Design, we realized we have a lot in common.  We went to the same highschool, played soccer on the same team, and competed together in robotics. Now we both study physics at UChicago. Crazy world. Despite all this, it wasn’t until we discovered a mutual pining for a creative outlet that we realized how similar we are. Crazier world.</p>
			<p>We started building furniture after receiving a grant from our school. There were a spate of projects at the start, all from friends who realized they needed something for their kitchen or bedroom. We were over the moon and not just because of the ridiculous artistic liberty we took with each request (how do you think we got our name). We were over the moon because we realized that the solution we found to our problem could provide people with solutions to theirs.</p> 
			<p>We believe that truly excellent design comes from good solutions to interesting problems. We’re out to prove that when different ideas flow in the same direction there is enough creativity out there to do design something different; something better. That’s why we wish to create and share this platform: to match problems with solutions, customers with designers, and thereby increase the flow of creative ideas.</p>
